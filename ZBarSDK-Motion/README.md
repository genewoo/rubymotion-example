Example of ZBarSDK
==================

This example is coming from [ZBarSDK](https://github.com/arciem/ZBarSDK).

And get reference from [BarCodeReader](https://github.com/Watson1978/RubyMotion-Samples/tree/master/ios/BarCodeReader) with personal adjustment.

- Reference by CocoaPod, instead of vendor. Minize code base.
- Alert in case you don't want to open Xcode to check log.
- Some simplified coding style.
- Added 2 sample code picture to verify it.
